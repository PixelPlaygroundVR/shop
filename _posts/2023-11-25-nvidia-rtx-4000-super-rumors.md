# NVIDIA RTX 4000 Super Series: Everything We Know So Far

NVIDIA appears to be gearing up for a refresh of its high-end graphics card lineup with the rumored RTX 4000 Super series. According to multiple industry leaks and reports, these new GPUs could launch as early as January 2024, potentially being unveiled at CES 2024.

## The Rumored Lineup

Based on information from reliable leakers and industry insiders, NVIDIA is expected to announce three new Super variants:

- **RTX 4070 Super**
- **RTX 4080 Super**
- **RTX 4090 Super** (less certain, but increasingly likely)

Let's break down what we know about each model so far.

## RTX 4070 Super: The Sweet Spot Gets Sweeter

The RTX 4070 has been widely regarded as the sweet spot in NVIDIA's current lineup, offering excellent 1440p gaming performance at a more reasonable price point than the 4080 and 4090. The Super variant is rumored to bring significant improvements:

- **CUDA Cores**: Increase from 5,888 to approximately 7,168 cores
- **Memory**: Same 12GB GDDR6X, but possibly with a wider 192-bit bus
- **Performance**: Expected 15-20% improvement over the standard RTX 4070
- **Pricing**: Likely around $599-649, potentially replacing the current RTX 4070

According to leaker @kopite7kimi on Twitter, the RTX 4070 Super will essentially be based on a cut-down version of the chip used in the RTX 4070 Ti, offering a substantial performance boost over the current 4070.

## RTX 4080 Super: Addressing the Value Proposition

The RTX 4080 has been criticized for its high launch price of $1,199, especially compared to the previous generation's 3080. The Super variant appears aimed at addressing this value proposition:

- **CUDA Cores**: Increase from 9,728 to approximately 10,240 cores
- **Memory**: Same 16GB GDDR6X, but with increased bandwidth
- **Performance**: Expected 10-15% improvement over the standard RTX 4080
- **Pricing**: Rumored to launch at $999, representing a significant price cut from the current 4080

This would position the 4080 Super much more competitively against AMD's high-end offerings and potentially replace the current RTX 4080 entirely.

## RTX 4090 Super: The New Flagship?

The most intriguing but least certain addition is the potential RTX 4090 Super. The current RTX 4090 is already an incredibly powerful card, so a Super variant would be pushing the limits of the Ada Lovelace architecture:

- **CUDA Cores**: Possible increase from 16,384 to around 17,408 cores
- **Memory**: Potential upgrade to 24GB or even 48GB of GDDR6X
- **Performance**: Estimated 5-10% improvement over the standard RTX 4090
- **Pricing**: Likely $1,999 or higher, positioning it as an ultra-premium option

Industry analyst Moore's Law Is Dead suggests that the 4090 Super could use a fully unlocked AD102 chip, which would make it the most powerful consumer GPU ever released.

## Potential Release Timeline

According to multiple sources, NVIDIA is targeting the following release schedule:

- **Announcement**: CES 2024 (January 8-12, 2024)
- **RTX 4070 Super & 4080 Super Release**: Mid-January 2024
- **RTX 4090 Super Release**: Late January or early February 2024

This timeline would allow NVIDIA to refresh its lineup before AMD's next-generation RDNA 4 GPUs arrive later in 2024.

## Why Is NVIDIA Releasing Super Cards Now?

There are several potential reasons for NVIDIA to refresh its RTX 4000 series with Super variants:

1. **Competitive Pressure**: AMD's RX 7900 XTX has been gaining market share in the high-end segment
2. **Improved Yields**: Better manufacturing yields may allow for more fully-enabled chips
3. **Market Segmentation**: Creating more price points to capture different consumer segments
4. **Clearing Inventory**: Potentially helping partners clear RTX 4000 stock before next-gen arrives

Industry analyst Jon Peddie suggests that NVIDIA is also looking to maintain momentum in the AI and content creation markets, where demand for high-end GPUs remains strong despite gaming GPU sales slowing.

## What This Means for Current RTX 4000 Owners

If you already own an RTX 4070, 4080, or 4090, there's likely no need to upgrade to the Super variants. The performance improvements, while notable, probably won't justify the cost of switching for most users.

However, if you've been holding off on purchasing a high-end GPU, waiting for the Super series might be worthwhile, especially if the rumored price adjustments prove accurate.

## What About RTX 4060 and 4050 Super?

Interestingly, there have been no substantial rumors about Super variants for the RTX 4060 or RTX 4050. This suggests NVIDIA may be focusing its Super refresh exclusively on the high-end segment, where profit margins are higher.

Some analysts speculate that mid-range and budget Super variants might come later in 2024, possibly as a response to AMD's mid-range offerings.

## Our Take: Wait If You Can

Given how close we potentially are to the announcement of these new cards, our recommendation is to wait if you're planning a high-end GPU purchase in the near future. Even if you don't end up buying a Super card, the release will likely drive down prices on the current RTX 4000 series.

For budget-conscious gamers, the potential RTX 4070 Super at around $599-649 could represent the best value proposition in NVIDIA's refreshed lineup, offering near-4070 Ti performance at a lower price point.
