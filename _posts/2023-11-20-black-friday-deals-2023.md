## When to Buy

While Black Friday officially falls on November 24th this year, many retailers have already started their sales events. Based on our price tracking data:

- **Gaming PCs & Laptops**: Buy now! Current discounts are at their peak.
- **Consoles**: Wait until Black Friday itself for potential bundle deals.
- **Monitors**: Current prices are good, but may drop slightly more on Cyber Monday.
- **Streaming Equipment**: Buy now, as popular items like the Stream Deck tend to sell out.
- **Peripherals**: Wait until Black Friday/Cyber Monday for the deepest discounts.

## Our Deal Selection Criteria

We've carefully selected these deals based on:

1. **Historical pricing data** - Ensuring these are actual discounts, not inflated "sales"
2. **Product quality** - Only recommending items we've tested or that have strong reviews
3. **Value for money** - Focusing on the best performance-to-price ratio
4. **Stock availability** - Prioritizing deals that should remain available
